# CryptoLib

The project is about creating a symmetric encryption, it has 5 versions 1,2,3 I do not recommend them, the truth can be broken with some ease version 4 has some small problems but in time it is more efficient than version 5, the problem of the v5 is that if you are going to encrypt a very long text or a file it may take a long time, (obviously depending on the speed of your computer and the amount of data)
